-- PostgreSQL-compatible version of CLUE Maryland ingestion script
-- This script transforms Maryland court case data and categorizes cases
-- Prerequisites: Run setup_postgres.sql first and load the CSV data
--
-- IMPORTANT: This version uses VIEWS instead of CTEs to enable
-- OpenMetadata lineage tracking. Each transformation step is a view
-- that can be tracked in the lineage graph.
